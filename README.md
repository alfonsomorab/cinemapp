# Cinemapp

This is a Flutter application, you can see more about the new movies in theaters now and populars movies, if you want you can search more information about any movie and see details like synopsis, actors and rating.

In this project I use the followings components:

- Connect with https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=es I use some APIs of this page, like now playing, search movie, most popular and more
- I use a extra feature to show cards in the main page https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_swiper
- I use Hero animation to show transition between pages
